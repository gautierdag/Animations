I approach the problem of transaction fees in the Bitcoin(1) network both from the question of the users and the effect of rising transaction fee in its use, but also from the view of the miner and the effect of the reward reduction on profitability. Bitcoin price through out this paper will be assumed to be at a price of $220 even though that is in fact more of a lower bound price, as its price in the past 6 months has typically fluctuated between $300 and $220. The paper is focused on an analysis of the blockchain and of mining hardware to determine the current state of the network as well as make predictions. I specifically looked at the reward halving, the networks way of incentivizing decentralization and minting new coins, as a potential flaw in the long run. Bitcoin is thus unsustainable in its current structure, and will either centralize towards few controlling mining entities, or it will effectively raise transaction fees to a level similar with other traditional means of exchange.
