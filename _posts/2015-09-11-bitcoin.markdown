I received an Undergraduate Summer Research Grant to carry out independent research
on the Sustainability of Bitcoins. I used python and beautiful soup to scrape data
from the Blockchain. I also analyzed the mining capabilities of technologies used
and their real profitability in the future. I conclude that Bitcoins are not sustainable
in the long term when the supply of minted coin decreases below a certain point. Check out the
full report [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uuygh3d1lvr4gng/The%20Sustainability%20of%20Bitcoin%20Transactions.pdf?dl=0).
