As the Northwestern User Experience Studio (NUX) lead student developer, I worked on developing the backend of an upcoming Northwestern geography game,
that looks to quiz students on general geography questions in order to promote learning of general knowledge. Using AWS lambda, Dynamo DB, and AWS API gateway I helped to implement the logic of the game. You can check the game out [here](https://dailynorthwestern.com/wildcat-geogame/) (only playable with NU credentials...)!
