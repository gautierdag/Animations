Cook Along helps make cooking multiple recipes at once easier by
interweaving steps in an optimal way. We pulls recipe data from allrecipes.com
and parse each instruction to look for keywords and determine how what does the step require (stove or oven) and for how long. Finally the Python backend schedules each step to minimize total cooking time while making sure to avoid conflicts.
