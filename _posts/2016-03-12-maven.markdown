I worked on the development of the Ionic hybrid app: MAVEN. MAVEN is an internal vendor rating system for the marketing departments of the university.
It is available for download on the PlayStore [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.northwestern.globalmarketing&hl=en) and as an enterprise iOS app.
