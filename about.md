<p>Hi, my name is Gautier Dagan. I am a Machine Learning Engineer ðŸ¤– at <a href="https://getmansa.com/" target="_blank">Mansa</a>! Building the future of lending and freelance work from London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ˜€ </p>
<p>I am very interested in: Natural Language Processing, Meta-Learning, Data Scraping and Analysis, but also in Game theory and International Relations.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
	I graduated Cum Laude from the University of Amsterdam with a MSc. in Artificial Intelligence in September 2019, where I focused on Language Emergence in Cultural Evolution. At the <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/" target="_blank"> Institute for Language, Logic and Computation</a>, I was part of the <a href="http://i-machine-think.github.io/" target="_blank">i-machine-think</a> research group working under the supervision of Dr. Elia Bruni. 
</p>
<p> Before that, I obtained my B.A. from Northwestern University in June 2017 pursuing three majors: Computer Science, Economics, and International Studies. </p>

<h2> Entrepreneurship </h2>
<p>In March 2016, I co-founded <a href="http://zcruit.com" target="_blank">Zcruit</a>, an emerging startup looking to bring predictive analytics to college football recruiting. We are a proud alumni of the Wildfire pre-accelerator program through <a href="http://thegarage.northwestern.edu/">the Garage</a> at Northwestern University. I left the team to pursue my Master's degree after we were aquired by Reigning Champs in November 2017. Since then, both the team and the product have continued to grow and flourish.
