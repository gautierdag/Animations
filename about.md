<p>Hi, my name is Gautier Dagan. I am a 2nd year Artificial Intelligence Master student at the University of Amsterdam. Currently working on my thesis at the <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/" target="_blank"> Institute for Language, Logic and Computation </a>, focusing on Language Emergence in Cultural Evolution. At the ILLC, I am part of the <a href="http://i-machine-think.github.io/" target="_blank">i-machine-think</a> research group working under the supervision of Dr. Elia Bruni. I obtained my B.A. from Northwestern University in June 2017 pursuing three majors: Computer Science, Economics, and International Studies. I am very interested in: Natural Language Processing, Meta-Learning, Data Scraping and Analysis, Human-computer Interaction, but also in Game theory, History, International Relations, and Microeconomics.</p>

<p>In March 2016, I co-founded <a href="http://zcruit.com" target="_blank">Zcruit</a>, an emerging startup looking to bring predictive analytics to college football recruiting. We are a proud alumni of the Wildfire pre-accelerator program through <a href="http://thegarage.northwestern.edu/">the Garage</a> at Northwestern University. I left the team to pursue my Master's degree after we were aquired by Reigning Champs in November 2017. Since then, both the team and the product have continued to grow and flourish.

Read more about Zcruit in the USA Today article that put us on the map: <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2017/01/23/analytical-approach-inexact-science-recruiting/96963326/" target="_blank">here</a>.
